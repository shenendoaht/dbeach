          Theatre is a radical act of empathy. Education is a radical act of
          empathy. The words of a playwright in the hands of an adept director
          and brought to life by able casts and crews can move the world towards
          something better. <br />
          Learning about the world, its real-life contexts and networks, helps
          us <em> be </em> something better.

          David Russell Beach is a playwright, director and educator. Born into
          a military family, he moved around as a kid and continued doing so as
          an adult until it was just time to settle down. He now makes his home
          in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Southwest Virginia with his husband,
          Bruce, and their menagerie of four-legged creatures. He fills his time
          with teaching, writing, directing, and sometimes acting with various
          theatre groups.

            David remembers stepping out on stage around age 3, before a showing
            of Cleopatra at the base cinema which his father ran. His first
            play, An Old Western Settlement, written in 6th grade, is lost to
            the ages, but he does remember the laugh line about the western
            settlers, circa 1860, needing penicillin for an infection. <br />
            <br />
            He has since become more adept at fact-checking. <br />
            <br />
            Over the years, David has attended thousands of performances on five
            continents ranging from elementary school shows to West End /
            Broadway productions.

          After a ten-year hiatus from the stage (to work on his Ph.D.), David
          returned to the boards playing Juror #8 in Twelve Angry Men. That
          started his involvement with two community theatres in Morgantown,
          West Virginia, with which he acted, directed, teched, draamaturged,
          built and painted sets, ran box office and concessions, and wrote a
          little on the side.

              One night, after a new play festival, two playwrights asked him to
              play the lead in their new play. The three of them and three
              others embarked on a four-month journey of re-thinking and
              re-envisioning the script, rehearsing, building the set, and
              having potentially fatal accidents in rehearsal and performance.

          worlds, in which we trust each other with words, actions and lives, we
          try to work out what's wrong with ourselves, our societies, our
          tribes, our -isms, in an attempt to remake our world better for all.
          It doesn't always work, of course, but we move forward, inch by inch,
          to let others see these worlds, to be agents of change, to call out
          the wrong, to enlighten our lives. The words of a playwright in the

          <h4 class="article-title">The Tragedy That Is Macbeth</h4>
          <h5>January 17th, 2022</h5>

            What was Joel Coen thinking? Because I'm not sure.

            <p>
              What was Joel Coen thinking? Because I'm not sure.<br />
              I loves me some Coen Brothers, and I really loves me some Frances
              McDormand. I kinda loves me some Denzel. Denzel in Much Ado about
              Nothing was sublime; Denzel in Fences, it was a film of a stage
              production.<br />
              That is how I experienced Joel Coen's recent film, The Tragedy of
              Macbeth. Shot first in color then converted to black and white in
              post-production (to get the RGB filtration curves) with a stark
              set, it was reminiscent of Alan Schneider's 1961 filmed play of
              Waiting for Godot with Zero Mostel and Burgess Meredith — stark,
              dark and dreary, and playing to the camera. I wasn't sure if it
              was experimental film, a graduate thesis project, or something
              entirely different. Maybe a combination of the three.<br />
              Are they in a desert? Or in the sand by the sea? Banquo is killed
              on a deserted road, and Fleance runs off into the bullrushes.
              Then, suddenly, Malcolm's troops are hewing the branches of the
              Burnam Woods which we've never really seen. When we're taken to
              Macduff's castle on a cliff, that was the first sense of place I
              had, far too long into the film to make sense. Production designer
              Stefan Deschant painted backdrops for the exterior scenes, even
              the sky. We know it's a stage and not real. “Everything is fake,
              and it's absolutely gorgeous,” said Deschant. I needed a stronger
              sense of place, but never really found it.<br />
              Bruno Delbonnel, the cinematographer, wanted the film to be a
              “cinematic haiku,” the simplest form of filmmaking to contrast
              with the richness and complexity of the language in the play.
              Composed in square (Academy aspect ratio) with wide-angle shots
              and extreme close-ups, the film was abstract, almost Brechtian.
              The Weird Sisters — definitely Brechtian, with one becoming
              origami, the reflection of one sister as three in the water, the
              three sisters in the rafters, witches and crows simultaneously.<br />
              I can't, and won't, complain about casting. Ellen Chenoweth always
              gathers superb casts (Doubt, O Brother Where Art Thou?, No Country
              for Old Men). But when both Macbeth and Macduff barely flinch when
              they learn their wives are dead, the motivation disappears. Maybe
              when one has the absolute power, nothing affects.<br />
              At one point, I thought of the Ryōan-ji Zen Temple in Kyoto.
              Fifteen stones are in the garden, but you can never see all
              fifteen at once, only fourteen. Something in the film is always
              hiding, and we can never see the entirety of the piece.<br />
              This nihilistic tragedy should move me. It did not. I truly looked
              forward to it from the day I heard about it. My hopes were too
              heightened. Yet, I'm glad they made it. As an educator, it allows
              me to show yet another adaption of a grand play, and we can pick
              apart all the elements, dissecting and analyzing them, in hopes
              that one day, maybe, a student will pick up the script, assemble a
              team, and do something even better.
